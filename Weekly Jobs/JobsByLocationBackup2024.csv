Job Title: .Net Architect
Job Location: Hyderabad
Job Type: FullTime

A .NET architect with experience in web development and mobile development is a professional who specializes in designing and implementing software solutions using the .NET framework. Here are some key aspects of their role and the skills and knowledge they typically possess:

Software Architecture: .NET architects are responsible for designing the overall architecture of software systems. This includes making high-level decisions about how the application will be structured, choosing the right technologies, and defining patterns and best practices.

.NET Framework: They have a deep understanding of the .NET framework, which is a versatile platform for developing a wide range of applications, including web and mobile.

Web Development: .NET architects are well-versed in web development, including ASP.NET for building web applications. They are proficient in creating web applications, designing web services, and working with databases.

Mobile Development: They also have experience in mobile development using .NET technologies. This typically involves using Xamarin/MAUI or other .NET-based frameworks for developing cross-platform mobile apps.

Programming Languages: Proficiency in programming languages such as C# and F# is crucial for a .NET architect. They should be able to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code.

Databases: A strong understanding of database design and management, including SQL Server, is often required, as databases are a crucial part of most software applications.

Design Patterns and Best Practices: .NET architects are well-versed in software design patterns and best practices, ensuring that the solutions they design are scalable, maintainable, and efficient.

Security: They understand security principles and best practices for web and mobile applications to protect against common vulnerabilities and threats.

Integration: Knowledge of integrating with various third-party services and APIs is essential, as many applications need to interact with external systems.

UI/UX: They may have knowledge of user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design principles, especially for mobile applications, to create user-friendly and visually appealing apps.

Version Control and DevOps: Familiarity with version control systems (e.g., Git) and DevOps practices is important for efficient collaboration and deployment.

Cloud Services: Understanding how to deploy and manage applications in cloud environments (e.g., Azure, AWS) can be valuable for scalability and reliability.

Communication and Leadership: As a senior role, .NET architects often need strong communication skills to work with development teams, project managers, and stakeholders. Leadership skills are also important when guiding development teams.

Problem-Solving: They should excel at problem-solving and be able to find efficient and effective solutions to complex technical challenges.

The Art of Sales is changing
The concept of selling has been around for decades, but businesses are digital now. The way sales are conducted must modernize too.
In most companies, sales teams are somewhere on the journey below:
(1) Sales scratches out their own leads by prospecting their networks, sending one-off or batch emails.
(2) Marketing turns over long lists of leads, which are typically contacts in your target audience
(3) Marketing has established a repeated process of generating MQL, SAL & SQL that yield some measurable returns. They sometime add lead scoring to this mix.
On the other hand, we at Adobe - GBD are a Modern Sales Team of 250+ Digital sellers, supported by analytics and data science teams. We are integrated with Adobe.com digital marketing & engagement funnel and are developing capabilities on picking cues from the customers demographic (who) & behavioral (what) data that they leave on their journey with our business to predict next ‘sales action’ that will lead to revenue conversions (Future state).
The Challenge:
We are looking for Digital Sellers who would be responsible for a defined patch of Adobe’s SMB customers and the role is pivoted around upselling and cross-selling Adobe Cloud based Solutions. You would be responsible for the Digital Media portfolio of Adobe.

What you’ll do as a CSAM
Develop understanding of Adobe's Digital Media line of products and lead with value-led conversations with customers for these solutions.
Create a value-based relationship with new & existing North American Adobe SMB customers.
Drive Up-sell & Cross-sell by prioritizing accounts with highest propensity to buy by clearly defining ideal customer profile and contact them via phones & emails.
Execute Marketing Qualified Leads with a defined SLA to maximize Revenue.
Research customer contracts and purchasing history in Adobe's various customer management systems & external sources such as LinkedIn, ZoomInfo, etc. to figure out the expansion opportunity in an account
Managing the opportunity pipeline from week to week, providing accurate and timely updates to management on progress and outlook.
Collaborate with Solution Specialists to maximize footprint of growing Adobe Solution streams like Adobe Sign, Substance, Stock, Frame.io, etc.
Engage as required, with the supporting functional teams to resolve issues raised by customers related to their Creative Cloud Subscriptions.
What you need to succeed
SMB Segment exposure and proven ability to manage a large customer set
3+ Years’ experience in a similar role, with experience in selling SAAS solutions preferred
Excellent communication Skills, both oral and written
Flair for Technology and ability to lead a customer conversation with value-selling rather than product features pitch.
Demonstrated ability to be a quick learner. Task oriented with focus and drive to complete tasks at hand.
Strong organization, follow-through and documentation skills suitable for customer communication.
International Sales Experience with exposure to NA markets preferably.
Working hours will coincide with the US Time Zones
Bachelor’s Degree or Equivalent
